*Welcome to the official Mathkeeb firmware repository.*

Firmware is open-source and uses TMK as a base. You can freely download and modify it as you wish. If we are violating some license by having this freely available, we apologize and please let us know by email at support@apgind.com

You can find the binaries under the releases. These will generally be the most up-to-date stable or beta versions of Mathkeeb firmware available. You can also find older versions here in case a newer one has problems.
